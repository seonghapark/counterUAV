## Urban Sound Classification 

The sources are from **https://github.com/aqibsaeed/Urban-Sound-Classification** repo for providing example of usage of neural network for sound classification.
**The source codes are using python 2.7, therefore they need to be modified to fit on python 3.5 or 3.6 version.**

The python library named **librosa** is the one that converts sound data into the form of input data for neural networks.

Below is the sample of urband sounds:

### Tools Required for the example codes:

Python 2.7 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Librosa

### Dataset for the example codes:

The UrbanSound8k dataset used for model training, can be downloaded from the following [[link]](https://serv.cusp.nyu.edu/projects/urbansounddataset/urbansound8k.html).

Another related dataset that can be used is Google's [AudioSet](https://research.google.com/audioset/).
